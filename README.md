# Reading List

There is no rhyme or reason to inclusion here except it's all stuff I'm interested in. "Interesting" is subjective and not objective here. This is a non-exhaustive list of papers I have read or am reading, organised by reading start date, with the most recently added paper at the top. If there's not a date on it, I haven't started reading it yet, but have probably printed it and put it in the local stack on my desk.

Why are the citations MLA? I like MLA. And it's the first citation format Google Scholar lists.

Why is paper A included but not paper B? I'd appreciate you teaching me about paper B's existence by making a PR to add it ;)
